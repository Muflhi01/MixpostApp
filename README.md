## About Mixpost Lite

Mixpost Lite is the free version of Mixpost.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.1 or higher
* Database (eg: MySQL, PostgresSQL, SQLite)
* Redis 6.2 or higher
* Web Server (eg: Apache, Nginx, IIS)
* URL Rewrite (eg: mod_rewrite for Apache)

## Installation

Install Mixpost Lite with composer:

```bash
composer create-project inovector/MixpostApp
```

### Configure the app url

You will need to modify the value of the APP_URL in the `.env` file to your project URL.

For example: `APP_URL=https://your-domain.com`

### Configure the database

You will need to modify the values of the DB_* entries in the `.env` file to make sure they are aligned with your database.

Then, run migration to create all tables.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Create the first user

After that you can create an initial user by executing:

```bash
php artisan mixpost-auth:create
```

You can log in to Mixpost at `/mixpost` using the user account you created.


## Server configuration (Manual)

*Please do not skip the server configuration step as it is important for Mixpost to work well.*

### Installing FFmpeg

Mixpost has the ability to generate images from video while uploading a video file. This would not be possible without
FFmpeg installed on your server.

You need to follow FFmpeg installation instructions on their [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

### Installing Redis
So that the posts can be scheduled, Mixpost puts them in the queue. 

To be able to do this, you need to install [Redis](https://redis.io/). 
Then, you will need to modify the values of the REDIS_* entries in the `.env` file to make sure they are aligned with your redis instance.

### Installing Supervisor
You need to configure a process monitor. To install Supervisor on Ubuntu, you may use the following command: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install supervisor
```

### Configuring Supervisor

Supervisor configuration files are typically stored in the `/etc/supervisor/conf.d`. 

Create the file `mixpost-horizon.conf` inside of `conf.d` folder and put this configuration content:

```bash
[program:mixpost_horizon]
process_name=%(program_name)s
command=php /path-to-your-project/artisan horizon
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=your_user_name
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/path-to-your-project/storage/logs/horizon.log
stopwaitsecs=3600
```
Once the configuration file has been created, you may update the Supervisor configuration and start the processes using the following commands:

```bash
sudo supervisorctl reread
 
sudo supervisorctl update
 
sudo supervisorctl start mixpost_horizon:*
```

### Cron
Add a cron that running the scheduler:

`* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`

### Other things to consider
Some files that are uploaded, video for example, can be up to 200 mb, by default most web servers have configured a much smaller limit. You will need to check this.

#### In `php.ini`:

```conf
post_max_size = 200M
upload_max_filesize = 200M
```

Then, restart your php process. For php fpm you can restart with:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm.service
sudo systemctl reload php8.1-fpm.service 
```

#### In `nginx.conf`:

```conf
http {
    client_max_body_size 200M;
}
```
Then, `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

#### For apache, `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.`

```conf
LimitRequestBody 209715200
```

Then: `sudo systemctl restart httpd`

## Docker Installation

<img src="./art/docker.webp" width="200px" alt="Logo Docker" />

<br>

**We provide you two methods of installing the Mixpost using Docker:**

 - Pull Docker image with all configurations.
 - Build Docker image and have full control.

## Pull Docker image with all configurations
This is the most suitable method. You can use [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) to install Mixpost Lite.

See image on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/inovector/mixpost). There are also the installation instructions.


## Build Docker Image
You can create a docker image that will have all server configurations and start the containers.

Download the latest version of Mixpost Lite from [here](https://github.com/inovector/MixpostApp/releases), copy .env.example to `.env`, and fill in all the necessary values:
```env
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
```

**Important**: the `DB_HOST` must be `mysql` and `REDIS_HOST` must be `redis`.

*Attention! If you have already installed the project with composer `composer create-project inovector/MixpostApp`, you can avoid step **3** below.*

### 1. Build Mixpost Lite image & Run the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Make the binary `mixpost` file executable:
```bash
chmod +x ./docker/mixpost
```
This binary will help you to avoid the long command `docker-compose exec -it -u mixpost app`. If you don't want to use this binary, you are free to use docker-compose command.

### 3. Execute these commands one by one to setup Mixpost Lite:

```bash
./docker/mixpost composer install
./docker/mixpost php artisan key:generate
./docker/mixpost php artisan mixpost:setup-gitignore
./docker/mixpost php artisan queue:batches-table
./docker/mixpost php artisan storage:link
```

### 4. And then you can migrate all tables:

```bash
./docker/mixpost php artisan migrate
```

### 5. Create the first user:
```bash
./docker/mixpost php artisan mixpost-auth:create
```

You can log in to Mixpost at `/mixpost` using the user account you created.
